The email spam detection project is a machine learning project that aims to identify spam emails. The project uses a dataset of emails that have been labeled as either spam or ham (not spam) with the binary values 1 and 0 respectively.

The project overview is as follows:

Load the email spam dataset.
Preprocess the data by extracting features from the emails, such as the words in the email body and the email subject.
Split the data into training and test sets.
Train a machine learning model on the training set.
Evaluate the model performance on the test set.

The project can be used to learn about the basics of machine learning and also be used to develop a model that can be used to detect spam emails in the real world.
